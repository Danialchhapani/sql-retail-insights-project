# Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the **sql-retail-insights-project** repository!

A SQL-based analysis of student survey data focused on retail purchase behavior and access control.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analytics solution, generating actionable insights from a real-world dataset. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights best practices in ETL, SQL analytics, and BI reporting.

## Project Overview

In the United States, a survey was conducted across multiple stores to understand student spending behavior. The dataset captures how much students spend on different categories such as Video Games, Indoor Games, Toys, Books, Gadgets, and more.

A key column in the dataset is Store Setting, which explains the type of location in which the store is present (e.g., Urban, Suburban, Rural). By analyzing this dataset, we aim to extract meaningful insights into spending patterns by store type.

This project involves:

**ETL** : Extracting, transforming, and loading survey data into SQL Server.

**Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards to highlight spending trends, store comparisons, and category performance.

This repository is an excellent resource for:

- Understanding student consumer behavior
- Practicing SQL analytics and BI reporting

## Project Requirement

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

- Student Spending Behavior (by category and store setting)
- Product Category Performance (e.g., Video Games vs. Books)
- Store Setting Trends (Urban vs. Rural vs. Suburban)

#### Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Import data from source provided as CSV files.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation to support both business stakeholders.

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making about store operations, product placement, and marketing.
